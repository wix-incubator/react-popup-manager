## [2.0.30] - 2021-04-05
### Added
- usePopupManager - add support for react-hooks

## [2.0.0] - 2020-05-14
### Fixed
- Transitions on show and hide were fixed! <br>
  There was an issue with the current approach to show and hide popups.<br>
  It added and removed dom elements, preventing the in-code transition solution of external popup-libraries.<br>
  ><i>for example: instead of fade out, it use to just disappear</i>
### Changed
- Changed `PopupManager` `close` approach:<br>
  Instead of adding and removing it from the DOM, it changes popup's `isOpen` prop.<br>
  This will allow in-library implemented transitions on `Open` and on `Close`.<br>
  > there is a threshold of closed popups.
### Added
to get the upgrade features that fix the animation issue you need to use these:
- `isOpen` - new `Prop` added to existing `PopupProps`. <br>
  The `props` that are added to consumers popup when calling `popupManager.open()` function.<br>

  >:warning:&nbsp;**Important** - &nbsp; must use in consumers popup otherwise it will never close

### Deprecated
- `popupProps.isOpen` in `PopupManager.open(component, popupProps)`  - is not allowed. is saved for internal use.
